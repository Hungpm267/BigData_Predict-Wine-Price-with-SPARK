# BigData_Predict-Wine-Price-with-SPARK
In this project, I implemented Exploratory Data Analysis to get insights into the Dataset. Then I performed Data Preprocessing and finally I Designed Class K-nearest-neighbors algorithm to predict wine price

This project is completely used by Pyspark in Jupyter Notebook
